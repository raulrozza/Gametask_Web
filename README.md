# GameTask Web

GameTask is an open-source gamification app, where users can create their own games, invite players and begin playing.

This is the admin panel, where you can create a new game and invite players to play it. The panel is being tested, and you can test it too by [clicking here](ufsc-tcc-web.herokuapp.com/).

The app is one component of the whole application. Feel free to also check the [GameTask APP](https://github.com/raulrozza/Gametask_Mobile) and the [GameTask API](https://github.com/raulrozza/Gametask_API)
